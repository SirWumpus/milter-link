Each of us fails from time to time. If we are wise, we accept these
failures as a necessary part of the learning process. But all too often as
parents and teachers we deny this same right to our children. We convey
either by words or by actions that failure is something to be ashamed of,
that nothing but top performance meets with our approval. 
Summer holiday in the south of franceand my family is subjected to the
usual overwrought chapter andverse of life with an actor.that is days of
total euphoria swiftly stymied by dragoons of doubt soldiering about all
over the place and ruining perfect weather and wonderful food. Doubt about
whether robbins¡¯ bob Roberts and coppola¡¯s Dracula or neither will come
through. A clear week interrupted by the real world of agents and
possibility.
