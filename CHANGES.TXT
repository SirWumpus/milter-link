--TODO--

   ?	Add http-proxy= option for +test-links. Requested by Quentin
   	Campbell.

   ?	Add support for list codes (vs. bit masks), a la SpamHaus.

   ?	Add support for "actions per bit", ie. tag, discard, reject.
   	Requested by Alex Broens.

--1.6.5--

   +	Forgot to add a date-policy option for date-required.

--1.6.4--

   +	Added date-required option to test for the presence and
   	conformance to RFC 5322 format.  Requested by Alex Broens.

--1.6.3--

   !	Silence repeated log messages about "mail-bl-max reached".
	Reported by Alex Broens.

--1.6.2--

   +	Added support for DISCARD action in access-db.

   !	Silence repeated log messages about "uri-max-test reached".
	Reported by Alex Broens.

--1.6.1--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.18

   +	Add support for milter-link-Helo: B/W tags. Requested by Alex Broens.

--1.6.0--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.75.8

   !	Overhaulled to apply PDQ, MIME, and URI API changes in libnsert
	1.75 and obtain latest library fixes.

  !!	Fixed segmentation faults when handling of SMDB_ACCESS_ERROR was
	changed between between 1.4.0 and 1.5.5.

--1.5.5--

   !	Fix up header inclusion; also include sqlite.h when available.

   !	filterOpen: Add stat and debug message when an unknown access
   	value is returned for a lookup.

   !	Fixed a potential seg. fault in filterMail that may come about
   	when there is auth_authen undefined (is NULL).

--1.5.4--

  !!	Fixed incorrect inequality concerning uri-max-tested.

   !	As an optimisation, when uri-max-tested is reached stop parsing
   	for additional URI in the message body. Requested by Alex Broens.

   !	testURI: Moved addition of seen URI from after DNS list to just
   	before.

   !	The "seen" URI and NS lists are now reset with each message.
	Note that "seen" MAIL list is NOT reset until end of session.

--1.5.3-- (private release)

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.74.11

   +	Added uri-max-test option to limit number of unique URI tested.


--1.5.2--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.74.2

   !	Fixed libsnert version test to allow for newer versions.

   !	Fix bug with filterUnknown command tempfailing unknown commands
	intended for other SnertSoft milters.

--1.5.1--

   !	Add more +info details.

   !	Fixed a seg. fault in filterMail that comes about when a sender
	address fails to parse; the syslog call referred to the wrong
	variable when attempting to log the sender.

   !	Updated the documentation.

--1.5.0--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.73.17

   +	Add special SMTP command "STAT milter-link" that reports some
   	basic process data. Can only be used from localhost for
   	security concerns. Appears to work only with sendmail and not
   	postfix.

   !	testURI: Remove duplicate code.

   !	When the origin host passes BL checks, add to uri_tested list.

   !	Do not reset mail_tested, ns_tested, nor uri_tested each
	message. These are lists of hosts/domains that passed the BL
	checks, so the results can be preserved for the SMTP session.

  !!	Yutz bug: Added domain-bl support but forgot to actually pre-
  	process the list into an internal form for the dnsListQueryName
	function call. Call me Homer DOH!

   !	Fix Postfix issues concerning {client_name} and {client_addr}
   	always coming back NULL. Use smfProlog to save the client name
   	and address supplied to filterOpen in the workspace.

--1.4.0--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.73.16

   +	Updated documentation concerning "combo" tag support added in
   	libsnert.

   +	Removed ENABLE_BLACKLIST macros in favour of it	always being
	compiled in. The original argument to disable blacklisting was
	that sendmail already had its own mechanism; however libsnert
	milter support provides a richer syntax especially with the
	addition of combo tags. Also it makes documentation easier.

  !!	Reengineered support for dbl.spamhaus.org by introducing
   	domain-bl option. dbl.spamhaus.org must be moved from uri-bl
   	to domain-bl for correct lookup operation, otherwise it is
   	possible to cause false-positives and be banned by SpamHaus.

   !	Reordered tests: 1. assorted uri BL tests; 2. uri-links-policy;
	3. if origin found, apply uri BL tests to origin.

   !	Weakened uri-links-policy test to only generate a reject for a
	redirection loop. Recommended by Papa Steve Freegard.


--1.3.0--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.73.14

   +	Added +version and +info command options.

   !	Moved uri-a-bl to last in the lookup sequence. Requested by
   	Alex Broens based on data set sizes and likely hood of a hit
   	vs. other lookups.

   !	Added support for dbl.spamhaus.org. See libsnert pdqGetDnsList
   	and dnsListQueryName.

--1.2.0--

   *	Requires LibSnert 1.73.10

   +	Added uri-ns-a-bl option.

   !	Fixed behaviour of uri-ns-bl; see dnsListQueryNs in libsnert.

--1.1.0--

   +	Added uri-bl-headers list option.

   !	Code for uri-bl-helo was incomplete.

   !	Cleaned up install script.

   +	Added uri-bl-port-list option

--1.0.0--

   *	Initial commercial source release.

   +	LibSnert 1.73.3

   !	Renamed options

   		dns-bl			>	uri-a-bl
   		ns-bl			>	uri-ns-bl
   		test-helo		>	uri-bl-helo
   		test-sub-domains 	>	uri-bl-sub-domains
   		policy			>	uri-bl-policy
   		policy-links		>	links-policy
   		test-links		>	links-test
		http-timeout		>	links-timeout

   !	Updated license.

--0.12.34--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.71.5

   +	Added mail-bl, mail-bl-policy, mail-bl-headers, mail-bl-max.
   	Commissioned on by Skull.

--0.11--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.71.1

   !	manual.shtml.in: minor documentation correction.

   !	Corrections for testing redirections in (pseudo) query string
   	elements.

--0.10--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.70.12

   +	Added dns-list-log-file and dns-list-log-what options.

--0.9--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.70.5

   !	Conversion to the improved URI and MIME APIs.

   !	Conversion to using the PDQ API for DNS lookups.

   +	Added ns-bl list option.

   -	Removed text-vs-inline. This was previously handled archaically
   	in the old URI/MIME parser. The newer MIME parser remains
   	independant of such things, leaving it up to call back handlers.
   	Currently no plans to re-implement.

   !	testUri: body: REJECT didn't work. data->policy had to be set to
	'r' of the SMDB_ACCESSS_REJECT case, otherwise filterEndMessage
	would not apply the rejection. Reported by Michael Grant.

   !	Added addition query string check for '/' delimiter to match the
   	behaviour of the uri CLI.

   !	filterHeader: added uriMimeFreeUri to clear possible URI
	gathered data from headers, which should not be occuring.

   !	filterEndMessage: make final call to mimeNextCh to signal EOF
   	and process last potential URI in the MIME decode buffer.

   !	testURI: the dns-bl option was broken following conversion to PDQ.

   !	sample.mc.in: Removed from define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl

--0.8--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.68

   +	Added access.samples, which contains a initial list of domains
   	that should not be queried as they tend to be good players.
   	These entries should be added to the access database.

   !	Added a string macro for "black listed URL host %s by %s" so
	that it can be more easily changed at compile time. Requested
	Alex Broens.

--0.7--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.66

   !	Fixed to find URI at the end of a message that does not end
   	with a newline, possibly leaving a URI in the MIME hold buffer
   	to parse. Reported by Jim Hermann.

   !	filterHeader() refetches the queue-id macro. Postfix doesn't set
   	the queue-id until DATA.

--0.6--

   !	Fixed possible off by one error for body chunks less than 20
   	bytes. Reported by Ben Lentz.

--0.5--

   !	Corrections of compiler warning for gcc version 4.1.0 20060304
	and 64-bit CPU, which is rather pedantic about char * vs
	unsigned char * issues.

--0.4.22--

   !	Fixed compiler warning on some systems concerning:
   	786: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type

--0.4--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.63.

   !	testURI log message demoted from TRACE to DEBUG.

   -	Dropped policy=later since RFC 2821 4.1.1.4 DATA paragraph 4
   	states that its not possible to return partial failure after
   	receiving the message; either accept or reject.

   -	Dropped uri-implicit-domain-min-dots in favour of a constant
   	value of 2 for MIME content filtering. A value of one can
   	result in too many false positives.

   !	The workspace subject header buffer was not reset to an empty
   	string at the start of each mail transaction. If a message had
   	no Subject header, then the milter would fail to add a tagged
   	subject header in the event it was identified as spam. Reported
   	by Larry Vaden.

   !	The documentation for milter-link-body when walk-about after
   	version 0.1.

   !	Moved milter-link-auth from before milter-link-from to just after.

   +	access-db now supports socket-map, flat-file, and SQLite3
	lookups in addition to Berkeley DB. The SQLite3 behaviour
	can be disabled via LibSnert's ./configure script.

   !	Rejection based on access-db blacklisting now disabled. Some
	users prefer leaving blacklisting upto Sendmail and not the
	milter. Reported by Derek Balling and others.

  !!	filterBody(): Fixed obsecure bug when the message content is
	less than 20 bytes long, adding a terminating NUL to the body
	chunk for the trace log output actually overwrote off the end
	of a dynamic buffer on some Linux systems causing the milter
	to crash. Reported by Martin Lathoud.

--0.3--

  !!	License 1.4 which provides additional details with regards to
  	possible license controls used, the possibility of "phone
  	home code" and its general contents, and related privacy
  	statement.

   +	Add check for filterOpen() got NULL socket address pointer
	passed to filterOpen() which inidicates an unsupported address
	type. The connection is simply accepted to bypass the milter.

   +	Add a bit-mask facility to handle aggregate lists like
   	multi.surbl.org. For example:

   	  uribl=multi.surbl.org/10,uribl.com

   +	Added policy-links for +test-links.


--0.2--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.61.

  !!	Complete replacement of option specification and no backwards.
	compatibility. The newer format allows for better integration
	of previously undocumented libsnert options and for the
	inclusion of future enhancements.

   +	Added -text-vs-inline option for to test for empty text/plain
	vs. inline content.

   +	Added -test-sub-domains option to test sub-domains of a URI.

   !	The previous -d option has been broken into two different
	options uri-bl= and dns-bl= to remove internal tests to
	distinguish between spamhaus.org and others. This should
	allows for other IP based DBS BL to be used.

   !	Many improvements made to uri.c in particular uriHttpOrigin();
	see LibSnert 1.61 changes.

   !	Fixed bug in mimeGetUri() boundary handling code that could
	cause a change in MIME content-type inappropiately. Reported
	by Ken Anderson .

--0.1--

   +	Requires LibSnert 1.60.

   +	Supports multi.surbl.org and sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org query
   	formats.

   + 	On-the-fly processing of multipart MIME, quoted-printable,
   	and Base64 decoding.

   +	Handles parsing of possible links missing an http:// prefix.
	If it looks like a FQDN, then try to test it.

   +	Handles processing of redirectors like:

   	http://autotrader.com/redirect/redirector_link.jsp?to_url=http://ic.fm0rt.com

   	http://translate.google.com/translate?u=www.fsl.com&langpair=en%7Cen&hl=en
